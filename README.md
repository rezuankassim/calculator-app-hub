## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### What I learned

I have learned how to switching themes and creating a working calculator following iOS calculator app. Even though it is easy when first thought about calculator but if deep deeper there is a lot of hidden logic that is not known.

There is some codes in here that I am proud of because it is my first time and I am managed to done it.

Lists:

- `./components/MultipleToggleSwitch.tsx` (Three way toggle)
- `./styles/globals.css` & `./tailwind.config.js` (Theme switching)

### Continued development

I would like to seperate more repetitive file into more smaller parts and tried out to call API because in this project there is no API to be called.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Theme Switcher](https://github.com/huphtur/tailwind-theme-switcher) - I am not experienced with theme switching before this but with this example I managed to figure out the way by looking through the source code.
